Architecture Overview
Each microservice will be independent and communicate via REST APIs or event-driven messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).

Microservices Breakdown:
User Service – Authentication & user management (Supabase Auth).

Product Service – CRUD operations for products.

Cart Service – Handles cart operations with atomic updates.

Order Service – Manages orders & order processing.

Payment Service – Handles payments (Stripe).

Notification Service – Sends emails and order updates.

API Gateway (Optional) – Central entry point for frontend requests.

Each service will be deployed as a separate container (Dockerized) and use PostgreSQL on Supabase.

Week-by-Week Development Plan
Week 1: Planning & Environment Setup
📌 Goals: Define microservices, set up repositories, and configure development tools.

✅ Define API contracts for microservices.
✅ Design PostgreSQL schema (split across services using shared DB or separate DBs).
✅ Set up GitHub repositories for each microservice.
✅ Configure Docker + Docker Compose for multi-container deployment.
✅ Implement Nginx as a reverse proxy for routing.
✅ Install PostgreSQL (or Supabase) for each microservice.
✅ Set up Supabase Auth for the User Service.

✅ 1. Define API Contracts for Microservices
Each service should expose a REST API with clearly defined endpoints. Here's a simple contract outline for each:

User Service
POST /register → Create a new user

POST /login → Authenticate user

GET /me → Get current user details

Product Service
GET /products → List all products

GET /products/:id → Get a single product

POST /products → Create a new product

PUT /products/:id → Update a product

DELETE /products/:id → Delete a product

Cart Service
GET /cart/:userId → Get user cart

POST /cart → Add item to cart

PUT /cart/:itemId → Update cart item quantity

DELETE /cart/:itemId → Remove cart item

Order Service
POST /orders → Create an order

GET /orders/:userId → Get user orders

GET /orders/admin → Admin panel orders

Payment Service
POST /payment/checkout → Create a checkout session (Stripe)

POST /payment/webhook → Handle payment webhooks

Notification Service
POST /notify → Send notification

GET /notifications/:userId → Get user notifications

Week 2: Backend Development (Microservices Core)
📌 Goals: Develop core microservices and establish inter-service communication.

✅ Implement User Service (Signup, Login, Logout).
✅ Develop Product Service (CRUD for products).
✅ Build Cart Service (Add/remove/update items with atomic updates).
✅ Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for async communication (e.g., order status updates).
✅ Implement Nginx or API Gateway for routing frontend requests to services.

Week 3: Frontend Development & Integration
📌 Goals: Build UI and integrate with backend services.

✅ Design UI with Bootstrap.
✅ Implement Redux for state management.
✅ Build product listing, cart, and checkout components.
✅ Connect frontend to API Gateway (or directly to microservices).
✅ Implement lazy loading for product images.

Week 4: Order, Payments & Notifications
📌 Goals: Implement checkout, payments, and notifications.

✅ Develop Order Service (Create, update, track orders).
✅ Implement Payment Service (Stripe integration).
✅ Implement Notification Service (Nodemailer for email updates).
✅ Ensure atomic transactions between Order & Payment Services.

Week 5: Deployment & Scalability
📌 Goals: Deploy services and make the system scalable.

✅ Dockerize each microservice.
✅ Deploy PostgreSQL on Supabase (or managed cloud DB).
✅ Host frontend on Vercel, Render, or AWS S3 + CloudFront.
✅ Deploy backend on Render, DigitalOcean, or AWS EC2.
✅ Implement load balancing (Nginx).
✅ Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for auto-deployment.

Week 6: Optimization, Security & Testing
📌 Goals: Improve performance, secure APIs, and run tests.

✅ Implement caching (Redis) for product listings.
✅ Add security layers (CORS, rate limiting, JWT expiration).
✅ Write unit & integration tests for each microservice.
✅ Perform E2E testing (Cypress).
✅ Conduct load testing (k6 or JMeter).

Final Deliverables:
✔️ Fully functional, microservices-based eCommerce store (MERN + PostgreSQL).
✔️ Independent microservices for scalability.
✔️ Secure authentication (Supabase Auth + RLS).
✔️ Stripe integration for payments.
✔️ CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
